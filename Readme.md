# Blazor Dash! - A .NET Blazor Web Game

## Overview

**Blazor Dash!** is a fun, fast-paced browser game built using the **.NET Blazor Server framework**.  
The player controls a small on-screen character that must dodge incoming obstacles appearing at increasing speed.  
The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score.

This project demonstrates how Blazor can power **real-time, and visually rich web applications**, combining C# game logic with Razor components and HTML canvas graphics.

## Meeting Summary

**Meeting Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Group Members Present:**
- Josuse Neiculeo
- Cristobal Baeriswyl

**Group Leader:** Josue Neiculeo   
**Next Group Leader:** Cristobal Baeriswyl 

**Summary:**  
The group began the meeting with prayer and discussed progress from this week’s Blazor learning activities. After reviewing several ideas inspired by popular casual games such as *Flappy Bird*, *Crossy Road*, and *Chrome Dino*, the group decided to build **Blazor Dash!**, an original obstacle-dodging game focused on fun, creativity, and .NET interactivity.

A Trello board was created for task management, and a GitHub repository was set up for collaboration.  
All members contributed to finalizing the project vision, scope, and technical setup.

## Project Proposal

### Title
**Blazor Dash! - A Fast-Paced Web Game Built with .NET**

### Project Overview
Blazor Dash! is a web-based, endless-runner style game where players must jump and dodge obstacles to survive as long as possible. The longer the player stays alive, the higher their score becomes. The simplicity and speed make it both fun and competitive.

The application highlights the power of **Blazor Server** to create smooth, interactive browser games using **C# and Razor components** instead of JavaScript.  
This project targets **casual web users** who enjoy short, fun gaming experiences that can be played directly in the browser.

## Project Scope

### What’s In
- A main menu with "Play," "How to Play," and "Leaderboard" options
- The main game screen with character movement and animated obstacles
- Collision detection (game over when player hits an obstacle)
- Score tracking (based on distance or survival time)
- Game restart functionality
- Responsive design compatible with desktop and mobile
- Custom Bootstrap and CSS arcade-style theme

### What’s Out
- Multiplayer gameplay
- Complex 3D graphics
- User authentication or login system
- External API integrations
- Monetization or ads
